                        <p>What?! Red Five standing by. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? What!?</p>
                        <p>What?! Red Five standing by. <strong> I'm trying not to, kid.</strong> <em> Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</em> The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
                        <h2>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</h2>
                        <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</li><li>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</li><li>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</h3>
                        <p>What!? Don't underestimate the Force. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</li><li>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</li><li>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. You mean it controls your actions? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
                        <p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I call it luck.</p>
                        <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? I find your lack of faith disturbing. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
                        <p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
                        <p>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</p>
                        <p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
                        <p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Ye-ha!</p>
                        <p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I call it luck. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</p>
                        <p>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
                        <p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.

                        <p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! He is here. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
